== Introduction

The Expense Tracker application is a desktop application which enables users to track their expenses. The application features both a Command Line Interface (CLI) and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) which provides users with the efficency of the CLI while still having the benefits of a GUI.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* All commands begin with the command word. The command word may be followed by parameters.
* According to the format of each command, words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters which can be specified by the user
** E.g. the `login` command has the format of `login USERNAME` where `USERNAME` is a parameter which can be replaced by a user specified value. In order to log in to an account with the username "username123", the user will enter the command `login username123`.
* Parameters in square brackets are optional
** E.g if a command has a parameter format of `n/EXPENSE_NAME [t/TAG]`, the parameters can be used as `n/Birthday Present t/Girlfriend`, which includes the "Girlfriend" tag, or as `n/Birthday Present`, which does not include a tag.
* Parameters with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times
** E.g. if a command format contains the parameter `[t/TAG]...`, the parameter can be replaced with `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command format specifies `n/NAME p/CATEGORY`, using the parameters `p/CATEGORY n/NAME` is also acceptable.

[NOTE]
====
* Before a user is logged in, only `login`, `signup` and `help` commands are useable.
